# MATH-RACER-PROJECT
Concept

Maths Racer is a unique racing game that combines the thrill of speed with the challenge of solving math problems. Players navigate through tracks while answering math questions. Correct answers provide a speed boost, while incorrect answers cause the player's vehicle to stall.

Gameplay

Progression

Players begin with a basic race car and compete on beginner tracks.
Winning races allows players to earn in-game currency.
This currency can be used to purchase upgrades for their car, such as increased speed, better handling, and cosmetic enhancements.
Challenge Mechanics

Each question solved increases the difficulty of subsequent math problems.
The time limit for answering each question also decreases as the game progresses, adding to the challenge.
